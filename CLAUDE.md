# Praxis Repository
## Claude Code Onboarding — Repo-Specific

**You have already read the global `CLAUDE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.**
**If you have not, stop. Go read them. The Laws defined there govern this repo.**
**This document adds Praxis-specific rules on top of those Laws.**

## What This Repo Is

Praxis (formerly The Creation Engine / TCE) is the sensory integration cortex of the E-T Systems digital organism. It captures three continuous signal streams — conversation, artifacts, and outcomes — and feeds them into an NG-Lite learning substrate. The substrate's learned topology handles classification, connection, surfacing, and learning automatically.

**Praxis does not generate code.** It provides context intelligence that makes vibe coding reliable, repeatable, and self-improving. It bridges knowing and doing — turns intent into practice. It provides session continuity.

**Status: v0.8.0 Alpha — all 8 phases complete.** Vendored files synced from NeuroGraph canonical (2026-03-18). All three pheromone sensors implemented. CPS with substrate-routed retrieval. Session Bridge solving context death. 79 tests passing.

## 2. Key Architectural Constraints

### Praxis Does NOT Write Autonomic State

Praxis reads `ng_autonomic.py` to adjust capture granularity. It does NOT write to it. Only security modules (Immunis, TrollGuard, Cricket) have write permission. This is a hard boundary — PRD §9.

### Praxis Does NOT Generate Code

Praxis is a context substrate, not a code generator. Code generation is the external LLM's job, selected and routed by TID. If you find yourself writing code that generates code, you are out of domain.

### Raw Experience Enters the Substrate (Law 7)

Signals enter the substrate as raw embeddings with fair starting values. No classification before the substrate sees the data. Classification emerges from learned topology.

### The Substrate Is the Pipeline (PRD §2.3)

There is no explicit routing, classification, or pipeline staged processing. The substrate handles classification through learned associations, connection through synaptic propagation, surfacing through voltage thresholds, and learning through STDP.

## 3. The Three Pheromones

| Sensor | File | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Conversation Stream | `sensors/conversation.py` | Full — temporal binding, both directions, multi-speaker |
| Artifact Stream | `sensors/artifact.py` | Full — lifecycle tracking, reference counting, stale detection |
| Outcome Stream | `sensors/outcome.py` | Full — reward signals, severity scaling, intent tracing |

All sensors extend `sensors/base.py` (SensorBase ABC).

---

## 4. Vendored Files

All five vendored files in `vendored/` directory, synced from NeuroGraph canonical on 2026-03-18:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ng_lite.py` | Tier 1 learning substrate |
| `ng_peer_bridge.py` | Tier 2 cross-module learning |
| `ng_ecosystem.py` | Tier management lifecycle |
| `ng_autonomic.py` | Autonomic state (**Praxis is read-only**) |
| `openclaw_adapter.py` | OpenClaw skill base class |

---

## 6. What Praxis Does NOT Do

- Text-level AI security (TrollGuard's domain)
- Host-level threat detection (Immunis's domain)
- System repair (THC's domain)
- Substrate maintenance, identity coherence (Elmer's domain)
- Model routing (TID's domain)
- Causal event logging (Bunyan's domain)
- Code generation (external LLM's job)
- Behavioral constraint enforcement (Cricket's domain)

When Praxis detects a signal that requires another module's capability, it records the observation on the substrate. The relevant module absorbs it through the River.
